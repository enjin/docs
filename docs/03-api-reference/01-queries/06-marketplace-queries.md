          "address": "cxNW84hdDPEr8rU8oUbqNDaCmVX6SxH86mFufTf6HiNbZhi2F"

      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

The `GetBid` query serves various use cases:

- **Audit and Verification**: You can use it to verify and audit bid details, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Market Analysis**: It aids in analyzing market behavior, helping you understand bidding patterns and the market value of listings.
- **User Interface Updates**: Developers can use this data to update user interfaces with real-time bid information. This enhances the user experience by keeping users informed about their bids or bids on listings they are interested in.

By providing access to bid-related data, the `GetBid` query is a fundamental tool for applications and systems that involve marketplaces and bidding processes.

## GetBids

The `GetBids` query is used to retrieve a list of bids for one or more market listings based on specified listing IDs. Unlike the `GetBid` query, which retrieves details of a single bid, `GetBids` can return multiple bids and includes pagination information.

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

The `GetBids` query serves various use cases:

- **Marketplace Insights**: You can use it to gain insights into the market by retrieving bid data for multiple listings. This helps you understand the level of activity and interest in various listings.
- **Data Analysis**: The retrieved data can be used for statistical analysis, trend identification, and understanding how the market responds to different listings.
- **User Interface**: For platforms displaying lists of bids on multiple items, this query ensures that users have access to comprehensive bid information across various listings.

While the `GetBid` query focuses on retrieving detailed information about a single bid, `GetBids` is suitable for scenarios where you need an overview of all bids related to specific listings, especially when dealing with a larger volume of bid data.

## GetListing

The `GetListing` query allows you to retrieve detailed information about a single market listing using its unique listing ID. This query provides a comprehensive overview of the listing's attributes, its state, sales history, bid history, and more.

### Use Case:

The `GetListing` query is valuable for various use cases:

- **Detailed Listing Information**: You can retrieve all essential information about a specific listing, making it useful for potential buyers to review listing details comprehensively.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: It includes historical states, sales, and bids, enabling users to track the listing's activity over time and analyze its market performance.
- **Transaction Preparation**: Sellers and buyers can prepare for transactions effectively by understanding the listing's terms, including price, minimum take value, and asset details.

Unlike queries like `GetBids` that focus on specific aspects of a listing, `GetListing` provides a holistic view of a single market listing, encapsulating all its attributes, history, and context in a single response. This makes it particularly useful for in-depth research and transaction preparation.

## GetListings

The `GetListings` query is used to retrieve information about multiple market listings from the Enjin Blockchain marketplace. Unlike the `GetListing` query, which fetches data for a single listing, `GetListings` is designed to handle multiple listings at once, making it suitable for scenarios where you need to fetch details for multiple listings in a single request.

### Use Case:

The `GetListings` query is valuable for various use cases:

- **Batch Data Retrieval**: You can efficiently retrieve detailed information about multiple listings in a single request, which is useful for batch processing or displaying a list of items on a user interface.
- **Marketplace Overview**: It allows you to obtain a comprehensive overview of multiple listings, making it easier to analyze and present marketplace data to users.
- **Pagination Support**: `GetListings` provides pagination details, making it suitable for handling large datasets of listings.

Compared to the `GetListing` query, which focuses on a single listing, `GetListings` is designed to cater to scenarios where you need to work with multiple listings simultaneously. It streamlines the data retrieval process, especially when dealing with large sets of listings, and includes pagination support for handling extensive listings efficiently.

## GetSale

The `GetSale` query is used to retrieve details about a specific sale transaction that has occurred on the Enjin Blockchain marketplace. This query requires the sale ID as input and returns information about the sale, including the sale ID, price, quantity, bidder information, and the associated market listing.

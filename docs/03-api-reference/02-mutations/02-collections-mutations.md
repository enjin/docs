## CreateCollection

The `CreateCollection` mutation is used to create a new on-chain collection. A collection serves as a grouping of on-chain assets, typically non-fungible tokens (NFTs), that share common properties or belong to the same set.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation CreateCollection {
    CreateCollection{
        id
        transactionId
        transactionHash
        method
        state
        encodedData
        wallet {
            account {
                publicKey
                address
            }
        }
        idempotencyKey
    }
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
```json
{
  "data": {
    "CreateCollection": {
      "id": 14058,
      "transactionId": null,
      "transactionHash": null,

    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

Utilize the `CreateCollection` mutation for streamlined initiation of new on-chain collections, offering distinct benefits:

- **Token Project Launch**: Perfect for new token ventures, it enables the structured organization and management of multiple tokens under one collection.

## ApproveCollection

The `ApproveCollection` mutation is used to authorize another account (referred to as the "operator") to transfer tokens from a specific collection account. This operation is common in scenarios involving Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or tokenized assets, where token management may need to be delegated without transferring ownership of the tokens.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation ApproveCollection {
    ApproveCollection(
        collectionId: "7154"
        operator: "0x965bcdbb46614cbd79869e2eb568825f6c038cbdf9085edb1b164607d3738fa6"

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

You can use the `ApproveCollection` mutation when you need to delegate token management within a collection to another account without transferring ownership. Here are some scenarios where this mutation is beneficial:

- **Delegated Token Management**: When users want to delegate the responsibility of managing their token transfers, they can use this mutation to grant specific accounts permission.
- **Token Marketplaces**: Operators on token marketplaces can receive approval to list tokens from a collection on their platform for trading.

## UnapproveCollection

The `UnapproveCollection` mutation is used to revoke previously granted permissions for a specific account (referred to as the "operator") to transfer items from a collection owned by the sender's account. This operation is essential for enhancing the security and control of digital assets, ensuring that the owner of a collection can manage who has the authority to move or transfer items from their collection.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation UnapproveCollection{
    UnapproveCollection(
        collectionId: "6305"
        operator: "0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d"      
    ) {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

You can use the `UnapproveCollection` mutation when you need to revoke a specific operator's permission to transfer items from a collection. Here are some scenarios where this mutation is beneficial:

- **Changing Operators**: If the relationship between the owner of the collection and the operator changes, you can use this mutation to revoke the operator's access.
- **Expired Permissions**: If the operator's permissions were set with a time limit or specific conditions that have now expired, you can revoke their access.
- **Security Control**: Enhance the security of digital assets by providing a straightforward method to revoke access when needed.

## MutateCollection

The `MutateCollection` mutation is utilized to modify the default settings of an existing collection. This mutation allows you to make changes to various parameters of a collection, such as adjusting royalty settings. It is particularly valuable when you need to alter how royalties are distributed for the assets within a specific collection.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation MutateCollection {
    MutateCollection(

- **Governance Updates**: To adapt to changing governance requirements or business agreements, you can modify collection parameters like royalties.
- **Market Competitiveness**: To stay competitive in a marketplace, you may need to fine-tune collection settings to align with market practices.

## Burn

The `Burn` mutation is used to permanently delete a specified amount of tokens from a collection. This operation is irreversible and results in the removal of tokens from circulation. When tokens are burned, the reserved value associated with them is often returned to the issuer's account.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation Burn {
    Burn(
        collectionId: "7154"
        params: {
          tokenId: {integer:6533}
            amount:1
            keepAlive:false
        }
    ) {
        id
        transactionId
        transactionHash
        method
        state
        encodedData
        wallet {
            account {
                publicKey
                address
            }
        }
    }
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
```json
{
  "data": {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

You can use the `Burn` mutation when you need to permanently remove tokens from circulation in a collection. Here are some scenarios where this mutation is useful:

- **Token Scarcity**: You want to increase the scarcity and value of remaining tokens by permanently deleting a portion of them.
- **Value Reclamation**: In systems where tokens have reserved value (e.g., ENJ-backed tokens), burning allows you to reclaim this reserved value.
- **Deflationary Models**: Burning tokens can be part of a deflationary economic model where tokens are periodically removed from circulation.

## DestroyCollection

The `DestroyCollection` mutation is used to permanently delete an existing collection. This operation is irreversible and removes the entire collection, including all associated tokens and their reserved values.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation DestroyCollection{
    DestroyCollection(collectionId: 10942) {
        id
        transactionId
        transactionHash
        method
        state
        encodedData
        wallet {
            account {
                publicKey
                address
            }
        }
    }
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
```json
{
  "data": {
    "DestroyCollection": {
      "id": 14062,
      "transactionId": null,
      "transactionHash": null,
      "method": "DestroyCollection",

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

You can use the `DestroyCollection` mutation when you want to permanently remove an entire collection of tokens from the blockchain. Here are some scenarios where this mutation is useful:

- **Unused Collections**: You have collections that are no longer needed or relevant, and you want to clean up the blockchain by removing them.
- **Reclaim Reserved Value**: Destroying a collection releases any reserved value associated with it, which can be a significant amount of resources.
- **Optimizing Blockchain Data**: By removing unused collections, you can optimize the data stored on the blockchain and reduce clutter.

## Freeze

The `Freeze` mutation is used to temporarily halt token transfers on a collection, token, collection account, or token account. Freezing temporarily prevents token transfers from taking place, which also results in marketplace listings being unpurchaseable.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">
```graphql
mutation Freeze {
  Freeze(
    freezeType: COLLECTION
    collectionId: "10943"

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

You can use the `Freeze` mutation in various scenarios where temporary halting of transfers is required:

- **Security Measures**: Freeze a collection or token in response to suspicious activities or during an investigation to secure the assets.
- **Administrative Control**: Temporarily halt transfers for maintenance, upgrades, or administrative actions.
- **Emergency Response**: Freeze assets in response to unforeseen events or emergencies to prevent harm or loss.

## SetCollectionAttribute

The `SetCollectionAttribute` mutation allows you to assign a new attribute or update an existing attribute's value within a collection.

### Use Case:

The `SetConsumption` mutation serves various purposes and can be particularly valuable in scenarios such as:

- **Manual Adjustments**: When you need to manually adjust fuel consumption to regulate usage.
- **Administrative Overrides**: For administrative purposes, you can use `SetConsumption` to override consumption data, making it useful for any situation where you need to take control of consumption rates.

To use `SetConsumption`, provide the `tankId`, `ruleSetId`, `userId`, `totalConsumed`, and `lastResetBlock`. Execute the mutation to set the desired consumption data. This mutation offers flexibility in managing fuel consumption records and allows you to make precise adjustments when needed.

## InsertRuleSet

The `InsertRuleSet` mutation is used to add a new rule set to a fuel tank. It allows you to define specific rules and requirements for the fuel tank's operation.

```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

The `InsertRuleSet` mutation is valuable for scenarios where you need to define and add new rule sets to fuel tanks. It allows you to set specific requirements and conditions for how the fuel tank should operate.

Here's how you can use it:

- **Adding Custom Rules**: You can use `InsertRuleSet` to insert custom rule sets that dictate how the fuel tank should behave in different situations.
- **Defining Requirements**: You can specify requirements such as the need for a particular token collection and token ID, ensuring that the fuel tank follows specific criteria.
- **Tracking Progress**: The mutation provides feedback on the state and details of the insertion, helping you monitor the progress and outcome of the operation.

By adding new rule sets, you can tailor the behavior of the fuel tank to suit your specific use cases and requirements, providing flexibility and control over its operations.

### Rules

When a call is made to a fuel tank, it must be made in accordance with a set of rules. These rules, known as rule sets, can include multiple individual rules that determine the validity of the call. A fuel tank can have multiple rule sets, each of which controls access and permissions to the fuel tank's functionality and resources.

##### Whitelisted Callers

Whitelisted callers are accounts that are explicitly granted permission to make calls to a fuel tank. Any calls made by accounts not on the whitelist will be rejected and fail.

##### Whitelisted Collections

Whitelisted collections refer to a list of specific collections allowed to be called by dispatch on a fuel tank. If a dispatch call is made to any collection, not on the whitelist, it will be rejected and fail. This ensures that calls are only made to the specific collections authorized to be accessed.

##### Max Fuel Burn Per Transaction

It is a setting that limits the amount of fuel that can be consumed in a single transaction. It is a safety measure that helps prevent misuse and overuse of the fuel tank's resources by ensuring that a single transaction doesn't consume too much fuel, which is important to ensure a sustainable network.

##### User Fuel Budget

A user fuel budget is the total amount of fuel allocated to a specific user across all rule sets of a fuel tank. It sets a limit on the amount of fuel that can be consumed by a user's transactions. Once the user's fuel budget is exhausted, their transactions will fail until more fuel is added to their budget or their overall consumption is lowered , which is meant to avoid the overuse of resources and ensure a sustainable network.\*\*

##### Tank Fuel Budget

A tank fuel budget is the total amount of fuel allocated to a specific fuel tank across all its rule sets. It sets a limit on the amount of fuel that can be consumed by all transactions made through that tank. Once the tank's fuel budget is exhausted, all transactions will fail until more fuel is added to the tank's budget or overall consumption is lowered.

##### Require Token

The "Require token" setting indicates that a specific token must be held by the caller for their call to be accepted by the fuel tank. If the caller does not possess the required token, their call will be rejected and fail. This feature is intended to ensure that only users who hold the specified token can access the fuel tank's functions and resources.

##### Permitted Calls

Permitted calls refer to a list of specific function calls that are allowed to be made using this rule set. Any calls made to other functions will be rejected and fail. This ensures that only authorized calls can be made by the users, and also, by setting a boundary to what calls are allowed and what calls are not, it helps to protect the network from unwanted transactions that could impact negatively on the network.

##### Permitted Extrinsics

Permitted extrinsics refer to a list of specific extrinsics that are allowed to be made using this rule set. Any extrinsics that are not on the list will be rejected and fail. This feature is used to restrict access to specific functionality and resources on the network and ensure that only authorized calls can be made by users. When setting this rule, it's important to note that the parameters passed to the extrinsic do not affect the outcome, only the function name is considered.\*\*

##### Freezing

"Freezing" is a state where a fuel tank or a rule set is temporarily prevented from accepting calls or making changes. This means that while a fuel tank or rule set is frozen, no dispatches are allowed to occur on it. This is implemented as a safety measure to prevent accidental or malicious changes and to ensure that the fuel tank or rule set remains in a stable state until the freeze is lifted.

##### Descriptor

A descriptor is a list of all the data needed to create a fuel tank. It includes details such as the fuel tank's name, account management rules, rule sets and other configuration information related to the fuel tank. The descriptor acts as a blueprint that defines how the fuel tank is set up and how it will function. It contains all the information needed to create and configure the fuel tank, and can be used to modify the fuel tank's settings.

## MutateFuelTank

The `MutateFuelTank` mutation is used to apply a specific mutation to a fuel tank. This mutation allows you to modify the Fuel Tank configuration.

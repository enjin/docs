```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use Case:

The `ApproveToken` mutation is exceptionally useful in various scenarios, including:

- **Fine-Grained Control**: Allowing token owners to delegate token management on a per-token basis, enabling precise control over who can transfer specific tokens and in what quantity.
- **Unique Token Management**: Facilitating the handling of tokens with varying values, attributes, or utilities within a collection.
- **Third-Party Management**: Enabling automated systems or trusted third parties to manage tokens without transferring ownership, a critical capability for various decentralized applications.

You can use `ApproveToken` when you need to establish highly specific permission structures for individual tokens. It offers a sophisticated level of control that is vital for scenarios where each token may have distinct permissions and use cases.

## UnapproveToken

The `UnapproveToken` mutation serves the purpose of revoking approval for a specific account (referred to as the "operator") to transfer a particular token from a token account. Unlike `UnapproveCollection`, which revokes permissions over an entire collection, `UnapproveToken` provides fine-grained control by targeting individual tokens within a collection. This level of precision is valuable when managing tokens with distinct values, attributes, or permissions within a collection.

<Tabs>

The `TransferAllBalance` mutation is a versatile operation with various practical use cases, including:

- **Emptying an Account**: You can use this mutation to completely empty a sender's account, ensuring that all available funds are transferred to another account.
- **Consolidating Funds**: When you need to consolidate funds from multiple accounts into a single account, this mutation simplifies the process.
- **Transferring Ownership**: In scenarios where you want to transfer ownership of an account, you can use `TransferAllBalance` to move all assets to the new owner's account, making it a seamless transition.

By executing the `TransferAllBalance` mutation, you, as a developer, provide users with a powerful tool for efficiently managing their account balances. It simplifies asset transfer operations by moving all available funds, eliminating the need for users to specify the exact amount, and ensuring that accounts remain operational as needed.

## Infuse

The Infuse mutation allows you to embed Enjin Coin (ENJ) into an existing token. This operation is crucial for enhancing the intrinsic value of digital assets, ensuring that they carry a guaranteed ENJ backing. By infusing ENJ, you provide tangible value to the token, which can only be retrieved through the process of "<GlossaryTerm id="melt" />ing" the token.

:::warning Important Note
The `amount` argument is denoted in `u128`. This means that the number you specify is divided by 10^18 to determine the actual amount of ENJ to be infused.
e.g.: to infuse a token with 5 ENJ, the infusion argument should be set to `5000000000000000000`, which is `5*(10^18)`.

### Use Case:

The `Infuse` mutation can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

- **Enhancing Asset Value**: Infuse ENJ into tokens to provide a base value, making them more attractive to collectors and investors.
- **Gaming and Virtual Worlds**: Game developers can infuse ENJ into in-game items, ensuring they have real-world value and appeal to players.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Businesses can issue tokens with infused ENJ, adding tangible value to customer loyalty points.
- **Crowdfunding**: Projects can offer tokens infused with ENJ to backers, ensuring their contributions hold inherent value.

By using the `Infuse` mutation, you can effectively increase the perceived and actual value of tokens, fostering trust and interest in your digital assets. Note that infusing is permitted only if you are the collection owner or if the token's `anyoneCanInfuse` state is set to true.

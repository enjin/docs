## GetAccounts

The `GetAccounts` query allows you to retrieve a comprehensive list of account details associated with a specific fuel tank in the Enjin API. Fuel tanks are a feature used to subsidize transaction fees on the Enjin Blockchain. This query provides a detailed overview of all accounts participating in the specified fuel tank.

### Use Case:

- **Fuel Tank Management**: The `GetFuelTank` query is essential for managing and overseeing the configuration of a specific fuel tank. It provides detailed insights into the tank's name, ownership, deposit policies, associated accounts, and rule sets.
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Users, especially administrators, can use this query to make strategic decisions about how the fuel tank operates. It helps in assessing security, compliance, and overall functionality.
- **Comprehensive Overview**: Unlike the `GetAccounts` query, which primarily focuses on the accounts within the fuel tank, `GetFuelTank` offers a broader and more configuration-centric overview of the entire fuel tank setup. It is valuable for understanding not only who is participating but also how the tank is configured and managed.

To utilize this query, provide the `tankId` of the desired fuel tank for which you want to retrieve detailed information. The response will provide a comprehensive snapshot of the specified fuel tank's configuration and operation, aiding in effective management and decision-making.

## GetFuelTanks

The `GetFuelTanks` query allows you to retrieve detailed information about multiple fuel tanks within the Enjin API simultaneously. This query is particularly useful when you need to obtain an overview or compare details of various fuel tanks within a system.

### Use Case:

- **Fuel Tank Management**: The `GetFuelTanks` query is valuable for managing and overseeing multiple fuel tanks within a system. It allows you to retrieve comprehensive data for multiple tanks in a single request, providing an efficient way to monitor and compare their configurations, rules, and ownership.
- **Comparison and Analysis**: Users, especially administrators, can use this query to compare configurations and rules across different fuel tanks, making it easier to assess similarities and differences. It is particularly useful for analyzing and auditing multiple fuel tanks in bulk.

To utilize this query, provide an array of `tankIds` representing the fuel tanks for which you want to retrieve detailed information. The response will provide a comprehensive snapshot of each specified fuel tank's configuration and operation, allowing you to efficiently manage and analyze multiple tanks in your system.

## Requirements

In general, requirements for running an Enjin node are quite similar to running a Substrate node.

Therefore, if you are not sure about specific details, you can always refer to the [official Substrate documentation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/). However, building a Matrixchain Node, i.e. Enjin Matrixchain node, requires a little more time and resources, since Matrixchain nodes also run a full Relaychain node.

### Hardware

For building and running an Enjin node, the recommended hardware is:

| Component  | Requirement           |
| :--------- | :-------------------- |
| OS         | Ubuntu 20.04 or newer |
| CPU        | 4 cores               |
| RAM        | 16 GB                 |
| Disk Space | 256 GB SSD            |

:::tip
It is recommended to have more disk space available (512 GB+) if you are running an Archive Node.

### Ports

This table shows the default ports that are used by the Enjin Matrixchain node and embedded Relaychain node:

| Description     | Ingress Port         | Egress Port               |
| :-------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------ |
| P2P             | **TCP** 30333, 30334 | **TCP** 443, 30333, 30334 |
| RPC (HTTP & WS) | **TCP** 9933         | -                         |
| Prometheus      | **TCP** 9615         | -                         |

This table shows the ports that are recommended to be exposed depending on the type of node you are running:

| Description     | Archive / RPC | Collator / Validator |
| :-------------- | :------------ | :------------------- |
| P2P             | **required**  | **required**         |
| RPC (HTTP & WS) | ✅             | ❌                    |
| Prometheus      | ✅             | ✅                    |

## Advanced

This section covers advanced topics associated with running the Enjin node.

### Node Key

Substrate nodes use node keys for identification in peer-to-peer communication. To generate a node key, use the [subkey tool](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/), which can be downloaded using the following command:

`cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey`

After installing the [subkey tool](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/), you can generate the node key using the following command:

`subkey generate-node-key --file ./node.key # or any other path`

### Purging the chain

To begin anew, without any chain history, you may want to purge the chain.

:::danger
The following will command will purge the chain data for the Enjin Matrixchain
:::

`./target/release/matrixchain purge-chain --chain mainnet`

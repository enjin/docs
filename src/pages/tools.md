## Canary Testnet Tools

To save time and money, we recommend building your initial proof-of-concept on Canary <GlossaryTerm id="testnet" /> – the fast and free environment for testing Enjin's tools.

[Enjin Blockchain Mainnet](#enjin-blockchain-mainnet-tools) is <GlossaryTerm id="immutable" />, which means all transactions processed on it will exist on its ledger forever and attract gas fees and will exist on its ledger forever.

### Building on Testnet

1. Download the [Enjin Wallet](https://enj.in/wallet).
2. Acquire some [cENJ](https://faucet.canary.enjin.io/) to test with.
3. Create an [Enjin Platform account](https://platform.canary.enjin.io).

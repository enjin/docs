Examples of NFTs include original artwork, gaming characters, pets, and numbered collectibles. \n\nNFTs can be categorized into families, referred to as Grouped NFTs. These NFTs have a shared Base ID but still retain their uniqueness. An illustration of this concept would be an Iron Sword armory consisting of swords of different quality levels, brands, and individual histories, but all identifiable as Iron Swords. The significance of a particular sword to one individual may be based on its past ownership by a great warrior, while another person may consider the token's type to be more important depending on its usefulness." },
